# OE Inspiration - Hands-On Practice 🚀

This repository contains the practical solution for the **Operational Excellence (OE)** training. The goal is to demonstrate the application of modern automation concepts, ensuring quality, maintainability, and efficiency.

## 🎯 Target Application
The **SauceDemo** application ([https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/)) was used to perform UI (User Interface) automation tests.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Playwright:** Next-generation automation framework.
* **TypeScript:** Language used for type safety and better developer experience.
* **Page Object Model (POM):** Design pattern used to organize page elements and actions.

## 💡 Applied OE Concepts
To ensure this project serves as a high-quality benchmark, the following pillars were applied:

1. **Maintainability:** Implementation of the POM pattern to centralize selectors, allowing for quick updates if the UI changes.
2. **Reliability:** Robust selectors based on stable attributes (`data-test`), significantly reducing test flakiness.
3. **Scalability:** Organized folder structure designed to support test suite growth without technical debt.
4. **Efficiency:** Automated reporting (Playwright HTML Reports) to streamline failure analysis and debugging.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/tacianaluz-objectedge/qa-oe-inspiration-tacianaluz.git](https://github.com/tacianaluz-objectedge/qa-oe-inspiration-tacianaluz.git)
